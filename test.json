Often set at night and in the cloudy waters of post-breakup sadness, both films in our double bill find the British artist-filmmaker immersed in introspection. In Surviving You, Always (2020) and A Human Certainty (2021), Quaintance is intermittently carried away from himself and his London surrounds by digressive streams of thought: reflecting on his family history across the Black Atlantic in one moment, then anti-psychiatry of the 1960s and photojournalism of the 1930s in the next. In the two shorts, he also beautifully captures the poor image that is memory: the people of the past are glimpsed in close-up and slow, staccato motion, with the image out of focus and further obscured by grainy, monochrome 16mm film. Quaintance supplements that uncertain image in various ways, continually combining written word, sound, music and image to create formally generous films. Writing as a critic for the magazine Art Monthly, Quaintance has recently decried the slide of British multiculturalism into a monoculture: everything looks the same, he laments, and says the same thing. Nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to these two shorts. Intensely intimate, tender and wry, his idiosyncratic films escape this contemporary condition.",

From theater and television to cinema, Fassbinder conquered them all. Imbued with a romantic yet anarchic spirit, his films relish the pleasure and pain of love as well as unrequited longing, all while attesting to the sociopolitical disorder creeping through postwar West Germany. In contrast to the deliberately theatrical staging of his earlier output, our Fassbinder focus centers on the later half of his career, where the director began to inject the stylistic elements of classic melodrama into his provocative character studies.\nSuch an artistic shift was brought on by his encounter with a retrospective of Douglas Sirk’s filmography in Munich in 1971. Transfixed by the older master’s melodramas, Fassbinder employed his now signature use of primary colors in the art direction and lighting of his subsequent films. Drawn to stories of women trapped by societal hierarchies as well as their own neuroses, Fassbinder often framed his heroines between mirrors, doors, and thresholds, signifying the possibility as well as the futility of escape and self-transformation. The queer poetics of diva worship are also present. As parts of his “BRD Trilogy”—named after the Bundesrepublik Deutschland—films such as Lola (1981) and Veronika Voss (1982) feature cabaret singers and film stars as protagonists, a nod to the silver-screen icons of the past. Blending kitschy glamor with seedy carnal desires, these shocking tableaux of debauchery posit how, in a world where the patriarchy strips women of their autonomy, the path to empowerment lies in the commodification of sexuality. For Fassbinder’s femme fatales, femininity is a kind of performance. In the same vein, his queer masterpiece In a Year of 13 Moons (1978) defies the binary of genders, sensitively portraying a transgender woman’s search for love amid an indifferent and grotesque humanity. Under Fassbinder’s command, irony and catharsis go hand in hand; he even viciously skewered political idealism with his riotous satire The Third Generation (1979). With his band of regular performers and collaborators, Fassbinder formed his own affront to any ideologies of coherence. At a time when the old order is dead and the future proves hopeless, Fassbinder’s cinema sets the ground on fire, building a new world out of its ashes.",

Often set at night and in the cloudy waters of post-breakup sadness, both films in our double bill find the British artist-filmmaker immersed in introspection. In Surviving You, Always (2020) and A Human Certainty (2021), Quaintance is intermittently carried away from himself and his London surrounds by digressive streams of thought: reflecting on his family history across the Black Atlantic in one moment, then anti-psychiatry of the 1960s and photojournalism of the 1930s in the next. In the two shorts, he also beautifully captures the poor image that is memory: the people of the past are glimpsed in close-up and slow, staccato motion, with the image out of focus and further obscured by grainy, monochrome 16mm film. Quaintance supplements that uncertain image in various ways, continually combining written word, sound, music and image to create formally generous films. Writing as a critic for the magazine Art Monthly, Quaintance has recently decried the slide of British multiculturalism into a monoculture: everything looks the same, he laments, and says the same thing. Nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to these two shorts. Intensely intimate, tender and wry, his idiosyncratic films escape this contemporary condition.",

Without optimal means of storage and care, delicate celluloid materials are at the destructive mercy of the elements. Established in 1990, the Film Foundation was set up to rescue fragile film prints that have languished in a state of neglect and deterioration, its principal aim to prevent known gaps in the world’s collective film history from widening into chasms. It’s estimated that for American cinema alone, some 50 percent of pre-1950 films, and 80 percent of movies from the silent era have been lost forever.

              "description": "Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the eternal enfant terrible of New German Cinema, was a formidable creative force who left behind a colossal body of work before his untimely death at the age of 37. From theater and television to cinema, Fassbinder conquered them all. Imbued with a romantic yet anarchic spirit, his films relish the pleasure and pain of love as well as unrequited longing, all while attesting to the sociopolitical disorder creeping through postwar West Germany. In contrast to the deliberately theatrical staging of his earlier output, our Fassbinder focus centers on the later half of his career, where the director began to inject the stylistic elements of classic melodrama into his provocative character studies.\nSuch an artistic shift was brought on by his encounter with a retrospective of Douglas Sirk’s filmography in Munich in 1971. Transfixed by the older master’s melodramas, Fassbinder employed his now signature use of primary colors in the art direction and lighting of his subsequent films. Drawn to stories of women trapped by societal hierarchies as well as their own neuroses, Fassbinder often framed his heroines between mirrors, doors, and thresholds, signifying the possibility as well as the futility of escape and self-transformation. The queer poetics of diva worship are also present. As parts of his “BRD Trilogy”—named after the Bundesrepublik Deutschland—films such as Lola (1981) and Veronika Voss (1982) feature cabaret singers and film stars as protagonists, a nod to the silver-screen icons of the past. Blending kitschy glamor with seedy carnal desires, these shocking tableaux of debauchery posit how, in a world where the patriarchy strips women of their autonomy, the path to empowerment lies in the commodification of sexuality. For Fassbinder’s femme fatales, femininity is a kind of performance. In the same vein, his queer masterpiece In a Year of 13 Moons (1978) defies the binary of genders, sensitively portraying a transgender woman’s search for love amid an indifferent and grotesque humanity. Under Fassbinder’s command, irony and catharsis go hand in hand; he even viciously skewered political idealism with his riotous satire The Third Generation (1979). With his band of regular performers and collaborators, Fassbinder formed his own affront to any ideologies of coherence. At a time when the old order is dead and the future proves hopeless, Fassbinder’s cinema sets the ground on fire, building a new world out of its ashes.",
